# project-signup
A project signup page to familiarize myself with HTML forms and how to style them.

## Things I've Learned
- You can move a particular element/container up or down by using `margin-{direction}`. So cool!
- Using `box-shadow` can really enhance the look of a web page. I should be using that more often!
- In a form, you can create a two, three, four, etc. column layout by creating a div for each "column" and using Flexbox to make adjustments accordingly.
